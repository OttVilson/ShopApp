# ShopApp

Extension of the final project in the Angular course by Mosh Hamedani (https://codewithmosh.com/). The current deployed version can be checked out from the URL https://shopapp-a724a.web.app/.

The work is in progress. Note that adding data requires the user to be an admin.

Otherwise an ordinary study project using Angular (https://angular.io/) and Firestore by Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

The code makes use of unpublished libraries [ngx-data-source](https://github.com/OttVilson/ngx-data-source) and [ngx-data-source-material-plugins](https://github.com/OttVilson/ngx-data-source-material-plugins). Follow the guidelines in the corresponding repositories to build the libraries locally.
